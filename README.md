1ST PROGRAM


his Java program is a basic calculator that takes user input for a mathematical expression and performs the corresponding operation. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

It imports the Scanner class to take input from the user.
The main method initializes a Scanner object for input and prompts the user to enter a mathematical expression.
It then splits the input expression into three parts (operands and operator) using the space as a delimiter.
It checks if the input is in the correct format (e.g., "5 + 10"). If not, it prints an error message and exits the program.
It attempts to convert the first and third parts into double values using Double.parseDouble. If the conversion fails (due to invalid numbers), it prints an error message and exits.
It determines the operator from the second part of the input and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation using a switch statement.
If the operator is division ("/"), it checks if the second operand is zero to avoid division by zero. If so, it prints an error message and exits.
It prints the result of the operation.
Overall, it's a simple calculator program that handles basic arithmetic operations. If you have any specific questions or if there's something you'd like to modify or discuss about the code, feel free to let me know!

2ND PROGRAM

This program seems to be a Java implementation for calculating statistics related to a group of students. It takes a string containing student names and their respective scores, processes the data, and then prints out various statistics such as the total number of students, average score, highest score along with the name of the highest scorer, and lowest score along with the name of the lowest scorer.

It's a simple yet effective program for analyzing student performance data. Do you want me to explain any specific part in more detail?
